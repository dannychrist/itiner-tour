# itiner-tour

Itiner-tour is a task-managing app created to keep the members of your band organzied on the road. Included is functionality to 
pick a day from a calendar and create/edit tasks to be viewed on a time grid. There are pre-loaded tasks included in a dropdown menu
that relate to everyday tasks an average band will experience on tour. The time grid may also be edited for when you wish to
start and end your days. This function helps in conserving useless scroll space. You may double click on each created task to edit 
time and name properties. The time you choose directly impacts how large the task object appears on screen. I've also implemented
'react-draggable' to add the ability to drag and drop each task to the appropriate time slot. On top of the general task managing functionality,
I've also included a user signup/signin screen with auth0 which saves new users to a database, and signs in users that are already in
the database. 

This app is a jumping off point to a much larger vision. I hope to implement functionality in the future to create multiple
days of a tour, choose what country/city/venue you will be traveling to, and synch to googleMaps so you will be able to view a map
of all tour dates, and how long the travel times will be between dates.
